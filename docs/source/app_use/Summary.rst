.. maskNMF summary

Summary
=======
This is a Dash app for GPU-accelerated interactive data analysis of functional neuroimaging data using the maskNMF pipeline. Through the app you can motion correct, compress, and demix large neuroimaging data. We provide convenient visualization options at each of these stages along the way. Finally, the app allows for a convenient export of compressed and demixed results for local viewing (via napari) and more. 

The app brings the following individual data analysis methods into one cohesive pipeline for fast interactive data analysis.
